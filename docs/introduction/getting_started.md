# Why Pipeleak? {#why}

Scanning for credentials in CI/CD pipelines is interesting because secrets often end up in pipeline logs or build artifacts that traditional Git scanners won’t check.
This means you can catch leaked secrets that are injected or generated at runtime, not just those committed to Git.

Once secrets are discovered, further exploitation often requires additional tooling. Pipeleak provides several helper commands to assist with this process.

# Getting Started

## Installation

### Install with Go

The recommended way to install Pipeleak is using Go:

```bash
go install github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleak/cmd/pipeleak@latest
```

### Linux

1. Visit the [Pipeleak GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleak/releases) page.

2. Download the binary for your architecture:

   - For Linux amd64: `pipeleak_<version>_linux_amd64`
   - For Linux arm64: `pipeleak_<version>_linux_arm64`

3. Make it executable and run it:

   ```bash
   chmod +x pipeleak_<version>_linux_amd64
   ./pipeleak_<version>_linux_amd64 --version
   ```

   You can rename or move it to a directory in your PATH:

   ```bash
   sudo mv pipeleak_<version>_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/pipeleak
   pipeleak --version
   ```

### macOS

1. Visit the [Pipeleak GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleak/releases) page.

2. Download the binary for your Mac architecture:

   - For Intel Macs (amd64): `pipeleak_<version>_darwin_amd64`
   - For Apple Silicon Macs (arm64): `pipeleak_<version>_darwin_arm64`

3. Make it executable and run it:

   ```bash
   chmod +x pipeleak_<version>_darwin_arm64
   ./pipeleak_<version>_darwin_arm64 --version
   ```

   You can move it to a directory in your PATH:

   ```bash
   sudo mv pipeleak_<version>_darwin_arm64 /usr/local/bin/pipeleak
   pipeleak --version
   ```

   **Note:** On first run, macOS may block the binary. You can allow it in System Settings → Privacy & Security, or run:

   ```bash
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine pipeleak
   ```

### Windows

1. Visit the [Pipeleak GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleak/releases) page.

2. Download the Windows binary for your architecture:

   - For Windows amd64: `pipeleak_<version>_windows_amd64.exe`
   - For Windows arm64: `pipeleak_<version>_windows_arm64.exe`

3. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and verify installation:

   ```powershell
   .\pipeleak_<version>_windows_amd64.exe --version
   ```

   You can rename it for convenience:

   ```powershell
   Rename-Item pipeleak_<version>_windows_amd64.exe pipeleak.exe
   .\pipeleak.exe --version
   ```

### Platform-Specific Binaries

Pipeleak also provides platform-specific binaries that include only the commands for a specific CI/CD platform. These are smaller and more focused:

- `pipeleak-gitlab_<version>_<os>_<arch>` - GitLab commands only
- `pipeleak-github_<version>_<os>_<arch>` - GitHub commands only
- `pipeleak-bitbucket_<version>_<os>_<arch>` - BitBucket commands only
- `pipeleak-devops_<version>_<os>_<arch>` - Azure DevOps commands only
- `pipeleak-gitea_<version>_<os>_<arch>` - Gitea commands only

These binaries are available for:

- Linux: amd64, arm64
- Windows: amd64, arm64
- macOS: amd64 (Intel), arm64 (Apple Silicon)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Scanning

The most basic example to scan e.g. GitLab pipeline logs for secrets. Check the docs for other platforms and more options.

```bash
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-[redacted] --gitlab https://gitlab.example.com
```

### Scanning Artifacts

In addition to logs, Pipeleak can also scan artifacts generated by pipelines.

Note that the `scan` commands must be configured to scan artifacts. This feature is disabled by default.

```bash
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-[redacted] --gitlab https://gitlab.example.com -a
```

### Result Confidence

The following confidence levels for detected secrets are used by default:

- `low`
- `medium`
- `high`
- `high-verified` these are validated by the corresponding TruffleHog validator.

> TruffleHog Verification is enabled by default! The verifiers test the found secrets actively, which means that logins happen on the respective platforms. Disable it for Opsec when needed.

However if you want to add custom levels, you can define any value in the `rules.yml` file.

To scan only for a specific level, you can specify it via CLI flag e.g `--confidence=high,medium`. Define multiple by comma separating the values.

Note: `high-verified` cannot be removed, but verification can be disabled using `--truffle-hog-verification=false`.

### Customizing Scan Rules

When you run Pipeleak for the first time, it generates a `rules.yml` file based on [this repository](https://github.com/mazen160/secrets-patterns-db/blob/master/db/rules-stable.yml). You can customize your scan rules by modifying this file as needed.

### Log Levels

Pipeleak supports different log levels to control output verbosity:

- **info** (default) - Standard informational messages
- **debug** - Detailed diagnostic information
- **warn** - Warning messages only
- **error** - Error messages only
- **trace** - Very detailed trace-level logging

You can set the log level in two ways:

**Using the verbose flag:**

```bash
# Short form - sets debug level
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com -v

# Long form with specific level
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com --log-level debug
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com --log-level trace
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com --log-level warn
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com --log-level error
```

**Interactive keybindings:**
During a scan, you can change log levels on the fly by pressing:

- `t` - Trace level
- `d` - Debug level
- `i` - Info level
- `w` - Warn level
- `e` - Error level
- `s` - Output current scan status
