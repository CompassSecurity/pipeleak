# Why Pipeleak? {#why}

Scanning for credentials in CI/CD pipelines is interesting because secrets often end up in pipeline logs or build artifacts that traditional Git scanners won’t check.
This means you can catch leaked secrets that are injected or generated at runtime, not just those committed to Git.

Once secrets are discovered, further exploitation often requires additional tooling. Pipeleak provides several helper commands to assist with this process.

# Getting Started

## Installation

### Linux / macOS

1. Visit the [Pipeleak GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleak/releases) page.

2. Download the binary for your operating system and architecture:

   - For Linux: `pipeleak-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`
   - For macOS: `pipeleak-<version>-darwin-<arch>.tar.gz`

3. Extract the archive:

   ```bash
   tar -xzf pipeleak-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz
   ```

4. Make the binary executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x pipeleak
   ```

5. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   ./pipeleak --help
   ```

### Windows

1. Visit the [Pipeleak GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleak/releases) page.

2. Download the Windows binary:

   - For 64-bit Windows: `pipeleak-<version>-windows-<arch>.zip`

3. Extract the ZIP archive to a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\Tools\pipeleak\`).

4. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and verify installation:
   ```powershell
   .\pipeleak.exe --help
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Scanning

The most basic example to scan e.g. GitLab pipeline logs for secrets. Check the docs for other platforms and more options.

```bash
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-[redacted] --gitlab https://gitlab.example.com
```

### Scanning Artifacts

In addition to logs, Pipeleak can also scan artifacts generated by pipelines.

Note that the `scan` commands must be configured to scan artifacts. This is feature is disabled by default.

```bash
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-[redacted] --gitlab https://gitlab.example.com -a
```

### Result Confidence

The following confidence levels for detected secrets are used by default:

- `low`
- `medium`
- `high`
- `high-verified` these are validated by the corresponding TruffleHog validator.

> TruffleHog Verification is enabled by default! The verifiers test the found secrets actively, which means that logins happen on the respective platforms. Disable it for Opsec when needed.

However if you want to add custom levels, you can define any value in the `rules.yml` file.

To scan only for a specific level, you can specify it via CLI flag e.g `--confidence=high,medium`. Define multiple by comma separating the values.

Note: `high-verified` cannot be removed, but verification can be disabled using `--truffle-hog-verification=false`.

### Customizing Scan Rules

When you run Pipeleak for the first time, it generates a `rules.yml` file based on [this repository](https://github.com/mazen160/secrets-patterns-db/blob/master/db/rules-stable.yml). You can customize your scan rules by modifying this file as needed.

### Log Levels

Pipeleak supports different log levels to control output verbosity:

- **info** (default) - Standard informational messages
- **debug** - Detailed diagnostic information
- **warn** - Warning messages only
- **error** - Error messages only
- **trace** - Very detailed trace-level logging

You can set the log level in two ways:

**Using the verbose flag:**

```bash
# Short form - sets debug level
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com -v

# Long form with specific level
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com --log-level debug
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com --log-level trace
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com --log-level warn
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com --log-level error
```

**Interactive keybindings:**
During a scan, you can change log levels on the fly by pressing:

- `t` - Trace level
- `d` - Debug level
- `i` - Info level
- `w` - Warn level
- `e` - Error level
- `s` - Output current scan status
