# The Why

Scanning for credentials in CI/CD pipelines is interesting because secrets often end up in pipeline configs, environment variables, or build artifacts—places that traditional git scanners like TruffleHog won’t check. 

Unlike tools like TruffleHog, which scan the git history for secrets, Pipeleak can scan pipeline logs and build artifacts produced during job runs. This means you can catch secrets that are injected or generated at runtime, not just those committed to git.

Artifacts (like zipped build outputs or logs) may contain credentials from failed jobs, debug output, or misconfigured scripts. Scanning these with Pipeleak might uncover more secrets as well.

# Getting Started

To get started with Pipeleak:

1. Visit the [Pipeleak GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleak/releases) page.
2. Download the binary for your operating system and architecture (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows).
3. Etract the archive
    ```bash
    tar -xzf pipeleak-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz
    ```
4. Make the binary executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x pipeleak
   ```
5. Run Pipeleak
   ```bash
   ./pipeleak --help
   ```
   This will show the available commands and options.

### Basic Example

The most basic example to scan e.g. GitLab pipeline logs for secrets, check the docs for other platforms and more options.

```shell
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxxxxxxxxxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com
```

### Scanning Artifacts

In addition to logs, Pipeleak can also scan artifacts generated by pipelines.

Note that the `scan` commands must be configured to scan artifacts. This is usually disabled by default.

```bash
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxxxxxxxxxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com -a 
```

### Result Confidence

The following confidence levels detected secrets are used by default:
* `low`
* `medium`
* `high`
* `high-verified` these are validated by the corresponding TruffleHog validator.

> TruffleHog Verification is enabled by default! The verificators test the found secrets actively, which means that logins happen on the respective platforms. Disable it for Opsec when needed.

However if you want to add custom levels, you can define any value in the `rules.yml` file.

To scan only for a specific level, you can specify it via CLI flag e.g `--confidence=high,medium`. Define multiple by comma separating the values.

Note: `high-verified` cannot be removed, but verification can be disabled using `--truffleHogVerification=false`.

### Customizing Scan Rules

When you run Pipeleak for the first time, it generates a `rules.yml` file based on [this repository](https://github.com/mazen160/secrets-patterns-db/blob/master/db/rules-stable.yml). You can customize your scan rules by modifying this file as needed.

### Keybindings

In the `scan` mode you can change interactively between log levels by pressing `t`: Trace, `d`: Debug, `i`: Info, `w`: Warn, `e`: Error. Pressing `s` will output the current status.

Todo: add main pages as well!!

### ELK Integration

To easily analyze the results you can [redirect the pipeleak](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk?tab=readme-ov-file#injecting-data) output using `nc` into Logstash.

Setup a local ELK stack using https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk. 

Then you can start a scan:
```bash
pipeleak gl scan --token glpat-xxxxxxxxxxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com  --json | nc -q0 localhost 50000
```

Using Kibana you can filter for interesting messages, based on the JSON attributes of the output.

e.g. `message.level=warn and message.confidence=verified` to find verified results.
