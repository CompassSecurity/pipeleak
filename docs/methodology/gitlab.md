# A Starter Guide To GitLab Pentesting

Many companies use (self-hosted) GitLab instances to manage their source codes. In times when a lot of infrastructure is deployed as code (IaC) these configurations must be source-controlled as well, putting a lot of responsibility on the source code platform used.

# Anonymous Access 
If you do not have credentials for the GitLab instance you might want to look at the public repositories and test if you can sign up for an account.

You can list the public projects under the path `/explore` for example `https://leakycompany.com/explore`. 

See if you can already identify potentially sensitive data e.g. credentials in source code or just generally repositories that should not be public. 
[Trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) is a great tool that automates this.

The next step would be to try to create an account. Head to `https://leakycompany.com/users/sign_up` and try to register a new account.
Sometimes you can only create an account with an email address managed by the customer, some instances require the admins to accept the register request, and others completely disable it.

# Authenticated Access 

Sweet now you have access to the GitLab instance with an account.
The first thing to look out for: What projects do I have access to? Is it more than unauthenticated? 
Some companies grant their developers `developer` access to each repository, this might become interesting.

> The main question: Is the access concept based on the least privilege principle?

## Known Vulnerabilities

Usually GitLab does disclose the installed version to auhtenticated users only.
You can check the version manually at `https://leakycompany.com/help`.

Using [pipeleak](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleak) we can automate this process and enumerates known vulnerabilities. 
Make sure to verify manually as well.

```bash

# Misconfigurations And Mishandling

## Enumerating CI/CD Variables And Secure Files
If you already have access to projects and groups you can try to enumerate CI/CD variables and use these for potential privilege escalation/lateral movement paths.

Dump all CI/CD variables you have access to, to find more secrets.
```bash
# Dump variables defined in the projects settings
pipeleak variables -g https://leakycompany.com -t glpat-[redacted]

# Schedules can have separately defined variables
pipeleak schedule -g https://leakycompany.com -t glpat-[redacted]

# Secure files are an alternative to variables and often times contain sensitive info
pipeleak secureFiles  --gitlab https://leakycompany.com --token glpat-[redacted]

2024-11-18T15:38:12Z INF Fetched all secure files
```

## Secret Detection in Source Code
Manually looking for sensitive info can be cumbersome and should be partially automated.

Use Trufflehog to find hardcoded secrets in the source code:
```bash
trufflehog gitlab --token=glpat-[redacted]
```

Note this only scanned repository you have access to. You can specify single repositories as well.

## Secret Detection in Pipelines And Artifacts

Nowadays most repositories make use of CI/CD pipelines. A config file per repository `.gitlab-ci.yml` defines what jobs are executed.

Many problems can arise when misconfiguring these.

* People print sensitive environment variables in the (sometimes public) job logs
* Debug logs contain sensitive information e.g. private keys or personal access tokens
* Created Artifacts contain sensitive stuff

**A few job output logs examples found in the wild:**

```bash
# Example 0
# Variations of this include e.g. `printenv`, `env` commands etc.
$ echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AKI[redacted]
$ echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
[redacted]
$ echo $S3_BUCKET
some-bucket-name
$ aws configure set region us-east-1
$ aws s3 cp ./myfile s3://$S3_BUCKET/$ARTIFACT_NAME
upload: target/myfile to s3://some-bucket-name/myfile

# Example 1
$ mkdir -p ./creds
$ echo $GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY | base64 -d > ./creds/serviceaccount.json
$ echo $GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY
[redacted]
$ cat ./creds/serviceaccount.json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "[redacted]",
  "private_key_id": "[redacted]",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----[redacted]-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "[redacted].iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "[redacted]",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "[redacted]",
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}
$ terraform init
Initializing the backend...
Successfully configured the backend "[redacted]"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

# Example 2
$ git remote set-url origin "${CI_REPOSITORY_URL}"
Executing "step_script" stage of the job script
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
Agent pid 13
$ echo "$PRIVATE_KEY"
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
[redacted]
```

There are many reasons why credentials might be included in the job output. Moreover, it is important to review generated artifacts as well. It is possible that credentials are not logged in the output but later saved in artifacts, that can be downloaded.

**Automating Pipeline Credential Leaks**

[Pipeleak](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleak) can be used to scan for credentials in the job outputs.

```bash
$ pipeleak scan --token glpat-[redacted] --gitlab https://gitlab.example.com -c [gitlab session cookie]]  -v -a -j 5 --confidence high-verified,high

Review the findings manually and tweak the flags according to your needs.

If you found any valid credentials, e.g. personal access tokens, cloud credentials, and so on, check if you can move laterally or escalate privileges.

**An example of privilege escalation:**

Pipeleak identified the following based64 encode secret in the environment variable `CI_REPO_TOKEN`:

```bash
CI_SERVER=yes
CI_REPO_TOKEN=Z[redacted]s=
FF_SET_PERMISSIONS_BEFORE_CLEANUP=true
CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA=998068b1
```

Decoding it shows that it is a GitLab personal access token, which is valid.
```bash
# Decoding the PAT
$ base64 -d
Z[redacted]s=
glpat-[remvoed]

# Verify using the API
curl --request GET --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: glpat-[redacted]" https://gitlab.com/api/v4/user/ | jq

Abusing this access token grants you access to the repository, thus escalating your privileges to this repository.

## Attacking Runners

Chances are high that if pipelines are used, custom runners are registered. These come in different flavors. Most of the time the docker executor is used, which allows pipelines to define container images in which their commands are executed. For a full list of possibilities [rtfm](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/).

If you can create projects or contribute to existing ones, you can interact with runners. We want to test if it is possible to escape from the runner context e.g. escape from the container to the host machine or if the runner leaks additional privileges e.g. in the form of attached files or environment variables set by the runner config.

First, you need to enumerate what (shared) runners are available.
Doing this manually by creating a project or navigating to an existing one.
Open the CI/CD Settings page and look at the Runners section: https://leakycompany.com/my-pentest-prject/-/settings/ci_cd
Runners can be attached globally, on the group level or on individual projects.

Using pipeleak we can automate runner enumeration:
```bash
$ pipeleak runners --token glpat-[redacted] --gitlab https://gitlab.example.com -v list
2024-09-26T14:26:54+02:00 INF group runner description=2-green.shared-gitlab-org.runners-manager.gitlab.com name=comp-test-ia paused=false runner=gitlab-runner tags=gitlab-org type=instance_type

```

Review the runners and select the interesting ones. The Gitlab Ci/CD config file allows you to select runners by their tags. Thus we create a list of the most interesting tags, printed by the command above.

Pipeleak can generate a `.gitlab-ci.yml` or directly create a project and launch the jobs.

```bash
