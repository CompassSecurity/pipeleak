# Pipeleak

Pipeleak is a tool designed to scan CI/CD logs and artifacts for secrets.

It supports the following platforms:
* GitLab
* GitHub
* BitBucket
* Azure DevOps

Once secrets are discovered, further exploitation often requires additional tooling. Pipeleak provides several helper commands to assist with this process.

## Getting Started

To begin using Pipeleak, download the latest binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleak/releases) page.

Detailed command documentation can be found in the [documentation](https://compasssecurity.github.io/pipeleak/introduction/getting_started/).
