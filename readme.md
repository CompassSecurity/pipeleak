# Pipeleak

Pipeleak is a tool designed to scan GitLab job output logs and artifacts for potential secrets.

## Getting Started

To begin using Pipeleak, download the latest binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleak/releases) page.

### Basic Usage

Run the following command to scan your GitLab instance:

```bash
pipeleak scan --token glpat-xxxxxxxxxxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com
```

### Scanning Artifacts

In addition to logs, Pipeleak can also scan artifacts generated by your pipelines.

```bash
pipeleak scan --token glpat-xxxxxxxxxxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com -a -c 
```

**Pro tip:**

> Note: Dotenv artifacts are not accessible through the GitLab API. To scan these, you need to manually provide your session cookie after logging in via a web browser. The session cookie name is `_gitlab_session`.

```bash
pipeleak scan --token glpat-xxxxxxxxxxx --gitlab https://gitlab.com -v -a -c [value-of-valid-_gitlab_session]
```

## Customizing Scan Rules

When you run Pipeleak for the first time, it generates a `rules.yml` file based on [this repository](https://github.com/mazen160/secrets-patterns-db/blob/master/db/rules-stable.yml). You can customize your scan rules by modifying this file as needed.
